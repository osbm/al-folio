I’m using this site to experiment with new technologies and to share my thoughts. To be honest I don’t know how to make a website. And I didn’t want to spend my time learning how to write a website using react, typescript, tailwindcss (yes I watch 100 second series by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">fireship</a> :smiley: ), or any other technology when I am in the process of learning PyTorch (im gonna cheat on my dear tensorflow).</p> <p>But I truly wanted to make a website/portfolio website for myself for a long time. Then I learned about static website generators. I learned that I could make a website just by writing in markdown. This was awesome. With the help of this awesome theme called <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> I can make a website for myself in just a few hours.</p> <p>I am planning to write regular posts here. Mostly about machine learning and deep learning.</p> <p>See you later, future people.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="external-services"/><category term="subjective"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[first blog in this new site]]></summary></entry></feed>
